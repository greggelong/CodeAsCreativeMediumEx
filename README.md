noise islands

Dreaming of getting out of the city and goingto the sea. For now only traveling imagination. These imaginary islands are created by visualizing 2d Perlin noise. Loop through the x y coordinates of the noise value and set ones smaller than 0.5 to blue. You can scroll through the world and come back to the same place.
