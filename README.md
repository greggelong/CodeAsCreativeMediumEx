# CodeAsCreativeMediumEx
a place to hold some processing sketches I made while doing the exercises in code as a creative medium

-----
another exercise from the book "Code as a Creative Medium" create a hexagonal grid. I thought it would be simple, but I needed to review some geometry to get the hexagons to fit. finding the radius is easy, but I needed to do some old school trig and learn about the apothem. I know it shouldn't be pronounced like the north American marsupial but I can't help reading it that way. #creativecoding #hexagon #math #apothem #processing #p5js
